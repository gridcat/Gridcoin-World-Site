                  You must install the BOINC client and select one or more BOINC
                  projects. Go to the <a href="https://boinc.berkeley.edu/">BOINC
                  website</a>, download and install BOINC for any computer that
                  you want to run BOINC on. If you don't choose projects that use
                  VirtualBox, the BOINC+VirtualBox package is not needed.

          <p>
              To earn Gridcoin, you need to crunch <a href="/whitelist.htm">
              whitelisted</a> BOINC projects on team Gridcoin.
          </p>
          <h4 class="h5">Project Selection Tips</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>
                  Choose projects with the least competition. Use
                  <a href="https://gridcoinstats.eu/">GridcoinStats</a> to
                  help identify such projects.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Select projects most compatible with your computer hardware.
                  Don't crunch GPU work with a CPU.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Verify that your projects have enough work available. You
                  don't want downtime while waiting for projects to generate
                  new work.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Have a backup project in case your primary project runs out
                  of work or goes down.

                  To earn Gridcoin in solo staking mode, you need to run the Gridcoin
                  client continuously. Install a client compatible with your operating
                  system.

                      If you installed the BOINC client anywhere other than the

                  <li>
                      You need to use the same email address for all BOINC projects.
                      Add this email to your gridcoinresearch.conf file (unless the
                      Gridcoin wizard has already done this for you).

                  In Gridcoin's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system, BOINC rewards are
                  given when users stake along with an additional 10 GRC.
              </p>
              <p>
                  To stake and earn your BOINC rewards, a balance of GRC is
                  required.
              </p>

              <ol>
                  <li>
                      For monthly staking, a balance of approximately 5000 GRC
                      is recommended.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      The rate you are rewarded for your BOINC work is the rate
                      you mint PoS blocks because BOINC rewards are layered on
                      top of these blocks.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Your balance does not affect the amount of the payout,
                      only how frequent. You need to wait around 16 hours for
                      received coins to become eligible to earn staking rewards.
                  </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                  If you don't want to buy any Gridcoin, you can get some through
                  the faucets or through <a href="#">pool mining</a>.
                  On most exchanges, you need to buy Bitcoin first in order to
                  buy Gridcoin.

                  <li>
                      Check that each project crunched is on team Gridcoin.
                      You will not earn rewards if they are not on the team.

                  <li>
                      Check that the CPIDs (cross-project identifiers) are the
                      same across your projects. You can check on each project
                      or check using
                      <a href="https://www.boincstats.com/">BOINCstats</a>.

                  <li>
                      In the wallet, go to the "overview" page and check the
                      message in the lower-left. Make sure it doesn't say
                      "INVESTOR".

                          <li>

                              If you set up BOINC in a non-default path, add
                              the path to the configuration file (see Step 4).

                      Unlock the wallet for staking only if locked. It is

                  <li>
                      Run the wallet close to 24/7. When your wallet is off,
                      you miss chances to stake blocks and earn rewards.

                  <li>
                      Every six months, you will need to send a beacon again.
                      Repeat the process shown in "Configure the Wallet" (Step
